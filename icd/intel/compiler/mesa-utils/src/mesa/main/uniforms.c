/**
 * Update the vertex/fragment program's TexturesUsed array.
 *
 * This needs to be called after glUniform(set sampler var) is called.
 * A call to glUniform(samplerVar, value) causes a sampler to point to a
 * particular texture unit.  We know the sampler's texture target
 * (1D/2D/3D/etc) from compile time but the sampler's texture unit is
 * set by glUniform() calls.
 *
 * So, scan the program->SamplerUnits[] and program->SamplerTargets[]
 * information to update the prog->TexturesUsed[] values.
 * Each value of TexturesUsed[unit] is one of zero, TEXTURE_1D_INDEX,
 * TEXTURE_2D_INDEX, TEXTURE_3D_INDEX, etc.
 * We'll use that info for state validation before rendering.
